I haven't read this yet on account of the length, but it seems relevant/
interesting.  The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing
By Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.  http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm

I’m pretty sure that this guy doesn’t actually count as an expert, but these
pages are reasonable and very easy to read (which I can’t necessarily say about
the "expert's" work)

“Data Transmission by Frequency-Division Multiplexing Using the Discrete
Fourier Transform” from IEEE in 1971.  It talks about a digital implementation
of the FFT, but I can’t pretend that I have read over it enough times to have
any idea how to implement what they are talking about.
(in weinstein1971.pdf)

note for me: convolution in frequency domain = multiplication in time domain

Implementation: Shifting center frequency = rotating the array of complex numbers
you get from the FFT. We're not actually rotating the complex numbers themselves.
The idea here is that you give the DFT a list of N samples "in time" and the DFT
gives you back N complex samples "in frequency". So when you want to shift things
in frequency, you sort of promote each sample to a higher frequency, by rotating
the array.

"Real-Time Pitch Shifting on an FPGA" by some ECE seniors at Villanova
University in 2006 The report focuses on hardware implementation, but is a
great overview of concepts and he includes DSP (digital signal processing)
code/ demonstrations.
