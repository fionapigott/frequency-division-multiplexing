% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

Representing real signals, then transmitting them efficiently and accurately is 
one of the most important processes of the information age. One important 
method of representing a time- or space- dependent signal in a way that 
inherently sorts out data in terms of its significance to the actual signal is 
representing the signal in the frequency domain, then transmitting it that way. 
A data set for a frequency domain signal can be cut down and insignificant data 
removed by cutting off the data when the frequency becomes so high as to be 
imperceptible to humans.
This paper discusses the Discrete Fourier Transform and the algorithmically 
advantageous version the Fast Fourier Transform and their use in transforming 
discrete sampled signals into the frequency domain and processing those signals 
(shifting frequency, limiting bandwidth etc). We discuss the mathematical and 
practical significance of using the FFT in Frequency Division Multiplexing over 
other, earlier techniques, and demonstrate digitally processing and 
transmitting a sound signal, similar to how FDM is used to transmit telephone 
conversations.

\section{Mathematical Formulation \\of Digital Signal Processing}

\subsection{Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem}

One of the most important results in signal processing, the Nyquist-Shannon 
Sampling Theorem (often simply the Nyquist Sampling Theorem) helps to develop 
the Discrete Fourier Transform.
% The result of this theorem is that for any 

\subsubsection{Proof}

Say the \(f(t)\) is some infinite function in the time domain, but note that 
this proof holds as well for a spacial \(f(x)\).

A signal \(f(t)\) is called \emph{band limited} if its Fourier transform is 
identically zero except in a finite interval.
\[\hat{f}(\omega) = 0 \quad \forall \, \omega \; \text{where} \; |\omega| > 
\Omega \text{ ``cutoff frequency"}\]
i.e., the signal is composed of a limited number of frequencies. Practically, 
most signals that are not completely random are band limited.

If \(f(t)\) is band limited:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nft}
f(t) = \inftyint \hat{f}(\omega)e^{i\omega t} \,d\omega \; = \; 
\int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} \hat{f}(\omega)e^{i\omega t} \,d\omega
\end{equation}

Now, since \( \hat{f}(\omega) \) is defined on a finite, rather than an 
infinite, interval, \( \hat{f}(\omega) \) can be expressed as as a summation 
rather than an integral:
\[\hat{f}(\omega) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} \hat{c}_{n}e^{\frac{i n \pi 
\omega}{\Omega}} \]
Where the complex coefficients \( \hat{c}_n\) are the Fourier transform of \( 
\hat{f}(\omega) \):
\[\hat{ c}_n = \frac{1}{2\Omega} \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} 
\hat{f}(\bar{\omega})e^{\frac{-i n \pi \bar{ \omega}}{\Omega}}\,d\bar{\omega}\]

Looking at \(\hat{c}_n\), and replacing \( \frac{-n\pi}{\Omega} = \bar{t}\) 
yield the definition of the Fourier transform of \( f(\bar{t})\):
\[ \hat{c}_n = \frac{1}{2\Omega} \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} 
\hat{f}(\bar{\omega})e^{i\bar{\omega}\bar{t}}\,d\bar{\omega} = 
\frac{1}{2\Omega} f(\bar{t}) = \frac{1}{2\Omega} f(\frac{-n\pi}{\Omega})\]

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nfhat}
\therefore \; \hat{f}(\omega) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
\hat{c}_{n}e^{\frac{i n \pi \omega}{\Omega}} = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
\frac{1}{2\Omega} f(\frac{-n\pi}{\Omega})e^{\frac{i n \pi \omega}{\Omega}} = 
\frac{1}{2\Omega} \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} f(\frac{n\pi}{\Omega})e^{-i 
\omega \frac{n \pi}{\Omega} } 
\end{equation}

Therefore, the Fourier transform can be completely determined by taking 
discrete samples of the function \( f(t) \) at only times t = \( 
\frac{n\pi}{\Omega}\). Because any function can always be recovered exactly 
from its Fourier transform, this implies that the band limited function \( f(t) 
\) can be completely determined by the same discrete set of samples.

Use \eqref{eq:nft} and \eqref{eq:nfhat} to reconstruct \( f(t)  \):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ndtft}
f(t) = \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} \frac{1}{2\Omega} \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
f(\frac{n\pi}{\Omega})e^{-i \omega \frac{n \pi}{\Omega} } e^{i\omega t} 
\,d\omega = \frac{1}{2\Omega} \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
f(\frac{n\pi}{\Omega}) \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} e^{-i \omega \frac{n 
\pi}{\Omega} } e^{i\omega t} \, d\omega
\end{equation}

And since the Fourier transform \( \hat{f}(\omega) \) is periodic with a period 
of \( 2\pi\), the sampling frequency \( n\) is given by:
\[ \frac{n\pi}{\Omega} = 2\pi \Rightarrow n = 2\Omega\]

Thus, the result of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem: any bandwidth limited 
function with the cutoff frequency \( \Omega \) in the time (or spacial) domain 
can be reconstructed exactly from samples taken at a rate of \( 2\Omega \).

% This was totally unnecessary to this proof (oops), but I'm going to hang on 
to it for now.
%\[  \hat{f}(\omega)  =\frac{1}{2\Omega}  \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
f(\frac{n\pi}{\Omega})e^{\frac{-i n \pi \omega}{\Omega}} \]
%
%Note that it is a property of the Fourier transform that:
%\[ \mathcal{F}(g(Ct)) = \frac{1}{C} \; \hat{g}(\frac{\omega}{C}) \]
%
%Which is easily shown. Taking the Fourier Transform of \(g(Ct)\) yields:
%\[ \mathcal{F}(g(Ct)) = \inftyint g(Ct)e^{-i\omega t} \,dt \]
%Performing a simple u-substitution for \(Ct\), \(u = Ct\):
%\[u = Ct  \Rightarrow du = Cdt \Rightarrow \frac{1}{C} \, du = dt \]
%\[ \mathcal{F}(g(u)) = \frac{1}{C}  \inftyint g(u)e^{-i\frac{\omega}{C} u} 
\,du = \frac{1}{C} \;  \hat{g}(\frac{\omega}{C}) \]


\subsubsection{Implications}

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is important because it demonstrates how 
to use digital processing (which is necessarily discrete) to analyze signals. 

In practice, many signals are only \emph{very nearly} band limited, meaning 
that the vast majority of frequencies are under a certain \( \Omega \), but 
some almost random noise causes some small frequency components \( \omega \) 
with \( |\omega| > \Omega \). The signal might also be artificially band 
limited because the sampling frequency \( f_s\) is determined by factors other 
than the signal's band (such as limited storage), and so the frequencies \( 
\omega \) in the signal are represented faithfully only for \(|\omega| < 
\frac{f_s}{2} \). Because samples at \( f_s > 2\Omega \) only correspond to 
unique periodic components with frequency \( < \frac{f_s}{2} \), samples from 
components with frequency \( > \frac{f_s}{2} \) are aliased to a frequency 
components with the same sample with frequency \( < \frac{f_s}{2} \). In both 
cases, this aliasing results in noise and distortion of the sound; aliasing is 
avoided only by understanding the frequency components of the time dependent 
signal. When small sampling frequency cannot be avoided, the added noise from 
aliasing can be eliminated by artificially bandwidth limiting the 
signal--taking the Fourier transform and setting it equal to zero outside of 
some band \( |\omega| > \frac{f_s}{2}  \). This way, information is lost, but 
the remaining signal is clearer. 

% I think some illustration of what aliasing means here (i.e. 2 sine waves with 
the same sample) would be helpful. Remind me to look/ create one.

\subsection{Discrete Fourier Transform}

The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem demonstrates that any band limited signal 
can be expressed as a discrete time signal. Furthermore, any practical signal 
with only periodic components is periodic on some interval. Call that interval 
\( T_0\). 

Say that for some sampling frequency \(f_s\), \(T_0 = N\frac{1}{f_{s}} \). 
Therefore, one period \( T_0\) can be divided into N intervals with length \( 
\frac{1}{f_{s}}\).

We know that the signal \(f(t)\) can be represented as the infinite sum of its 
frequency components, with coefficients \(c_n\).

\[ f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} \,c_n e^{i\omega t} \]
\[ c_{n} = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{0}^{T_0} f(t) e^{i\omega t} dt\]

Because we defined \(T_0\) as the period of the function, \(c_{n}(\omega) \) 
should have a period of \( T_0\), \(e^{i\omega T_0} = e^{i\omega nT_0}\). Since 
\(e^{i x}\) has a period of \( 2\pi \), \( \omega \) must be equal to 
\(\frac{2\pi n}{T_0} \). 

\[ \therefore c_{n} = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{0}^{T_0} f(t) e^{i \frac{2\pi}{T_0} t 
} \; dt\] 

Now, using the Left-Hand Riemann sum to approximate \( c_n\) with \( N\) 
intervals of \( \frac{1}{f_s} \):
\[ c_{n} = \frac{1}{T_0} \frac{1}{f_s} \; \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} f(k \frac{1}{f_s}) 
e^{i \frac{2\pi n}{T_0} k\frac{1}{f_s}} \]

Which simplifies to:
\[ c_{n} = \frac{1}{N} \; \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} f(k \frac{1}{f_s}) e^{i \frac{2\pi 
n}{N}k} \]

Written where \( f(k \frac{1}{f_s}) =\) the indexed sample \(f_k\), spaced 
\(\frac{1}{f_s}\) apart, this Riemann sum yields the common form of the 
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):
\[ c_{n} = \frac{1}{N} \; \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} f_k e^{i \frac{2\pi n}{N}k} \]

And from the discussion of Nyquist sampling frequency above, we know that as 
long as \(f_s = 2\Omega\), the signal's DFT will be non-aliased representation 
of its continuous Fourier transform.

%From equation \eqref{eq:nfhat}, note that:
%\[\hat{f}(\omega)  = \frac{1}{2\Omega} \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} 
f(\frac{n\pi}{\Omega})e^{-i \omega \frac{n \pi}{\Omega} } \]
%
%Now say that the signal that is being processed lasts for time N. In that 
case, it can be repeated infinitely to get a signal periodic in N. So one 
period of \(\hat{f}(\omega) \), call it \(\hat{f}_{k}(\omega) \) is given by:
%

%I feel like I grasp this somewhat, but I can't develop it in a way that I'm 
satisfied with.
